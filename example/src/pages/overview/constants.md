If your demo or page uses a versioned library (Mapbox GL JS, Turf JS, etc), you should use a site constant instead of pasting version numbers directly into your demo.

* A list of available site constants can be found in `src/constants.json`.
* If a particular constant is not listed, add it in your pull request. Do not add access tokens to this file.
