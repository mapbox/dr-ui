## Limitations

There are several known limitations to using split pages:

- All headings must be unique across all pages that come together on the main page.
- You _must_ create redirects for each for the markdown partial pages. See [Create redirects](#4-create-redirects) section.
- The main page must be a JavaScript file (not markdown). This will enable the scrollspy sidebar to sync properly with the content headings.
