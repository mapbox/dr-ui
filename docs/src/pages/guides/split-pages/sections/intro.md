This page demonstrates the split page pattern and provides steps on how to implement it on a site.

To improve internal developer experience, the pattern splits a longer page into multiple markdown files (also known as partial files) and then imports the markdown files into a single page.

This split page pattern is used by the following pages:

- [API documentation](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/maps/)
- [Studio manual reference](https://docs.mapbox.com/studio-manual/reference/)
- [Accounts pricing page](https://docs.mapbox.com/accounts/overview/pricing/)
- [Vector Tiles Specification](https://docs.mapbox.com/vector-tiles/specification/)
