## Introduction to split pages

This pages is a demo of using split pages and steps on how to implement it on a site.

To improve developer experience, we sometimes split a long page into multiple markdown files and then allow Batfish to combine them into a single page.

This split pages pattern is used by API documentation, Studio Manual, and Accounts.
