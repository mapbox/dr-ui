This section of the catalog site illustrates how grouped guides look and work including:

- A summary page layout (using `GuideGroupIndex`) on the `index.md` page.
- A list of grouped guides in the sidebar (in the `NavigationAccordion`) that is displayed when the group title is clicked (in this case, "Grouped guides"). The `NavigationAccordion` will hide the list of grouped guides when you click on a different item in the sidebar.
- Links to next guide in the group (using `NextPage`) at the bottom of the main content in guides that are grouped.
