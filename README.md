# @mapbox/dr-ui

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/mapbox/dr-ui.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/mapbox/dr-ui)

Pronounced "Doctor UI". **D**ocumentation **R**eact **UI** components. See [@mapbox/mr-ui](https://github.com/mapbox/mr-ui).

UI components for Mapbox documentation projects.

**This project is for internal Mapbox usage.** The code is open source and we appreciate bug reports; but we will only consider feature requests and pull requests from Mapbox developers.

## Installation

```
npm install @mapbox/dr-ui
```

On Mapbox projects, pair these components with version 0.26.0 of Mapbox's custom [Assembly](https://labs.mapbox.com/assembly/) build. (This is not in `peerDependencies` because you might use `<link>` and `<script>` tags instead of the npm package.)

The public Assembly build should work fine, with maybe one or two hiccups.

## Usage

**Import individual components!** All components are exposed at `@mapbox/dr-ui/{component-name}`. For example:

```js
import Card from '@mapbox/dr-ui/card';
import BackToTopButton from '@mapbox/dr-ui/back-to-top-button';
```

Only the component itself and whatever _it_ depends on will be drawn into your bundle.

## Development

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
